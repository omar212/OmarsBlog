I developed a full-stack blog application using React and Next.js, incorporating MongoDB for database management. This project showcased my proficiency in front-end technologies like CSS and responsive layout design, as well as back-end implementation utilizing Next.js API routes and MongoDB with Prisma. Additionally, I implemented user authentication with Google OAuth and incorporated features such as pagination, comment creation, and image uploading using Firebase, demonstrating my comprehensive skill set in web development.
